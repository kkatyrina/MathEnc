*-Autonomous category --:-- Let be a symmetric closed monoidal category (cf. also Category ). A functor is a duality functor if there exists an isomorphism , natural in and , such that for all objects the following diagram commutes: where in the bottom arrow . A category is -autonomous if it is a symmetric monoidal closed category with a given duality functor. It so happens that -autonomous categories have real-life applications: they are models of (at least the finite part of) linear logic and have uses in modelling processes. An example of a -autonomous category is the category of sets and relations; duality is given by . In fact, . From a given symmetric monoidal closed category and an object in it (that serves as a dualizing object) one can construct a -autonomous category (the so-called Chu construction, ). It can be viewed as a kind of generalized topology. 
*-regular ring --:-- A regular ring (in the sense of von Neumann) admitting an involutory anti-automorphism such that implies . An idempotent of a -regular ring is called a projector if . Every left (right) ideal of a -regular ring is generated by a unique projector. One can thus speak of the lattice of projectors of a -regular ring. If this lattice is complete , then it is a continuous geometry. A complemented modular lattice (cf. also Lattice with complements ) having a homogeneous basis , where , is an ortho-complemented lattice if and only if it is isomorphic to the lattice of projectors of some -regular ring. 
3-Sasakian manifold --:-- Sasakian and -Sasakian spaces are odd-dimensional companions of Kähler and hyper-Kähler manifolds, respectively. A Riemannian manifold of dimension is called Sasakian if the holonomy group of the metric cone reduces to a subgroup of . In particular, , , and such a cone is a Kähler manifold . Let be a complex structure on . Then restricted to is a unit Killing vector field (cf. also Killing vector ) with the property that the sectional curvature of every section containing equals one. Such a is called the characteristic vector field on and its properties can be used as an alternative characterization of a Sasakian manifold. Similarly, one says that is a -Sasakian manifold if the holonomy group of the metric cone reduces to a subgroup of . In particular, , , and the cone is a hyper-Kähler manifold. When is -Sasakian, the hyper-Kähler structure on the associated cone can be used to define three vector fields , , where is a hypercomplex structure on . It follows that, when restricted to , are Killing vector fields such that and . Hence, they are orthonormal and locally define an isometric (or ) action on . In turn, the triple yields and for each . The collection of tensors is traditionally called the -Sasakian structure on . This is the way such structures were first introduced in the work of C. Udrişte and Y. Kuo in 1969 and 1970. Every -Sasakian manifold is an Einstein manifold with positive Einstein constant . If is complete, it is compact with finite fundamental group . If is compact, the characteristic vector fields are complete and define a -dimensional foliation on . The leaves of this foliation are necessarily compact, since defines a locally free action on . Hence, the foliation is automatically almost-regular and the space of leaves is a compact orbifold, denoted by . The leaves of are totally geodesic submanifolds of constant sectional curvature equal one (cf. also Totally-geodesic manifold ). They are all -dimensional homogeneous spherical space forms , wher
A-integral --:-- One of the generalizations of the Lebesgue integral , given by E. Titchmarsh for the integration of functions conjugate to summable ones. A measurable function is called -integrable over if and if exists, where The number is called the -integral. It is denoted by 
A-operation --:-- operation A set-theoretical operation, discovered by P.S. Aleksandrov (see also , ). Let be a system of sets indexed by all finite sequences of natural numbers. The set where the union is over all infinite sequences of natural numbers, is called the result of the -operation applied to the system . The use of the -operation for the system of intervals of the number line gives sets (called -sets in honour of Aleksandrov) which need not be Borel sets (see -set ; Descriptive set theory ). The -operation is stronger than the operation of countable union and countable intersection, and is idempotent. With respect to -operations, the Baire property (of subsets of an arbitrary topological space) and the property of being Lebesgue measurable are invariant.
